-- ROD Optimization Claim:
-- (1) Skip ROD if the event leaves the dot set of the thread it is in unchanged.
--     Applies to fork, release and write.
--     The exception being acquire.
-- (2) Always apply ROD for acquire.
--      We acquire a new lock, so must check lock history.
-- (3) Skip ROD for subsequent reads from the same thread that are synced against the same write.
--       What if there's an acquire in between?
--       Seems fine cause the acquire applies ROD. See ex7.

-- NOTE: Subsequent acquire? Can also skip.
-- We can ignore a critical section for same thread t
-- if ROD on that critical section has been applied in thread t.


-- NOTE: this was modified to add fork, because own implementation relies on it

-- Optimization examples.
-- The naive PWR algorithm maintains a global list of the history of all critical sections.
-- Issue:
--   (1) Can only remove a critical seciton if all threads have applied ROD for this critical section.
--   (2) Like WCP, we can maintain thread-local histories.
--
--  NOTE: WCP uses queues. WCP deques as long as a sync must be done.
--  Examples ex9 and ex9b show that for PWR we can not use the same form of iteration through the history.
--
-- ex9:
--  Thread t2 encounters the history [CS_0, CS_1], recording critical sections in the order
--  as they appear in the trace. We apply ROD on CS_1 but not on CS_0.
--
--
-- ex9b:
--  Thread t2 encounters the history [CS_0, CS_1], recording critical sections in the order
--  as they appear in the trace. We apply ROD on CS_0 but not on CS_1.
--
-- ex9 and ex9b show that CS can be removed in that thread after application of ROD.
-- We still might want to catch "consecutive reads", avoids unnecessary scan through
-- the thread-local history.

-- Notation. We write CS_W to denote that the critical section CS only contains writes on variables W.
-- CHECK:
--   Claim: A later CS_W makes an earlier CS'_W obsolete.
--   This ought to hold. Neither CS_W nor CS'_W will sync with any other critical section.
--   If in the current thread we sync against CS_W, then this is due to a WRD.
--   But due to the "last write" assumption, this makes CS'_W obsolete!
